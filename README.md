# Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./images/Architecture.drawio.png)

1. **Web Browser (Client)**: The user interact with a static site hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. **GitHub Pages (Static Site)**: Delivers the site‚Äôs content. When you hit ‚ÄúGenerate Quiz‚Äù, the site communicates with our backend.
3. **Azure Container Apps**: The FastAPI backend processes your quiz request and works with different AI providers.
4. **AI Providers**: Multiple AI services process your input and generate unique quiz questions.

## Docker Compose Setup for Local Testing

This project uses Docker Compose to run both the FastAPI backend and the frontend services locally.

### Services

- **fastapi_generate_quiz**:  
  The FastAPI backend handles quiz generation by interacting with various AI providers.

- **frontend**:  
  A static version of the front end for local testing (even though the production site is on GitHub Pages).

### Running Locally

1. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Make sure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment or in a `.env` file at the project root:
   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Containers**  
   From the project root, run:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This command builds and starts both the backend and frontend containers.

3. **Access the Services**  
   - **Backend API (FastAPI)**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

With these steps, you can easily test both the backend API and the static frontend locally using Docker Compose.
